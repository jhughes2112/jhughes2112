ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jhughes2112.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in bits, particularly 1's but also fond of 0's.

I've made video games for countless moons, and in my search for new and shiny, have become somewhat adept at Kubernetes, Docker, C#, Unity, and learning new things.  My public repos are a smattering of things I have built (or fixed) and given away for anyone who might find it useful as a starting point in their endeavors.
